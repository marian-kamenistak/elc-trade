/**
 * Bundle entry for scripts/gen-agent-card.mjs. Prints the agent card as JSON on stdout.
 *
 * This exists so the published /.well-known/agent-card.json is GENERATED from the same
 * service registry the Worker serves, never hand-maintained. The card that was on
 * elc-web before this shipped had drifted onto the dead A2A 0.3 schema and had invented
 * `transport` and `protocol` fields inside supportedInterfaces that appear in no version
 * of the spec — exactly what hand-maintenance produces.
 *
 * Same precedent as elc-web's scripts/gen-agent-skills.mjs: a well-known artifact is a
 * build output, not a source file.
